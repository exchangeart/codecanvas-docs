# Submission

To submit your generative art project to Code Canvas, make sure to follow the guidelines provided in the documentation. 

This includes ensuring your project is responsive, providing a capture mode, and using trigger-based capture to 
output the necessary attributes.

Once you're ready to submit, create a `.zip` file of your project that includes all necessary files, 
including any external dependencies. Then, submit your project through the Code Canvas submission portal.

If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to the Code Canvas team for assistance.

Thank you for choosing Code Canvas as your platform for generative art!
