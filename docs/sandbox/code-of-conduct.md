# Code Canvas Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

At Code Canvas, we are committed to fostering a positive and inclusive environment, where every individual is treated with respect and dignity. Our mission is to establish a fair and secure space for both developers and users. By actively participating in our community, you signify your commitment to uphold the following code of conduct:

### 1. Embrace Diversity and Respect
Value the diverse backgrounds, identities, and beliefs of all members. Discrimination, including racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, ageism, or any other form, will not be tolerated.

### 2. Harassment-Free Zone
Maintain a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, bullying, or discrimination. This includes offensive comments, unwelcome advances, and any form of intimidation.

### 3. Inclusive Language
Use language that is inclusive and considerate, refraining from offensive jokes, slurs, and derogatory remarks that may make others feel unwelcome.

### 4. Foster Open Communication
Promote an environment of open and constructive communication. Actively listen, be receptive to others' opinions, and engage in discussions with empathy. Disagreements are natural but should be approached respectfully.

### 5. Reporting Violations
Promptly report any violations of this code of conduct to the Code Canvas team. All reports will be treated seriously and handled confidentially.

### 6. Consequences
Violations may result in appropriate actions, such as warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent moderation, as deemed necessary.

Remember, Code Canvas is a shared space where everyone deserves to feel safe and valued. By adhering to this code of conduct, you contribute to creating a welcoming and supportive community for all.

## Beyond this, specific guidelines apply to creating and sharing projects on Code Canvas.

## Developers’ Commitment

### Artistic Expression:
Code Canvas celebrates each developer's potential to contribute unique and inspiring projects. By committing to excellence in your craft, you not only elevate your skills but also enrich the entire community.

### Encouraging Feedback:
Encourage and support fellow developers, offering constructive feedback with sensitivity and respect. Foster an environment where artists feel supported and encouraged.

### Ensuring Determinism:
Projects on Code Canvas should adhere to a deterministic approach to randomness, ideally producing the same result given the same input. Generative Tokens with inconsistent results will be moderated.

### Originality and Transformation:
Ensure your work is transformative and unique. If inspired by others, evolve the concept into something new. Similar projects may be moderated if misleading towards collectors.

### Handling Images and Layered Artworks:
Adhere to communication guidelines for projects involving layered PNGs. Clearly describe the methods in project descriptions, and use appropriate tags.

### Describing Projects:
Thoroughly describe the methods used in project descriptions, using appropriate tags. Misleading language may result in moderation.

### Responsible Rescheduling:
Use the rescheduling feature only under specific circumstances. Abusing the system will result in moderation.

## Collectors’ Standards

### Discouraging Advantaged Buying:
Discourage botting; Code Canvas includes anti-botting mechanisms. Advantaged buyers may face consequences, including verification removal and public exposure.

### Combatting Market Manipulation:
Code Canvas takes attempts at market manipulation seriously. Users trying to manipulate the market may face consequences, including moderation and reputation loss.
