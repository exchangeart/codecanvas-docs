# Where is the Art Stored?

Welcome to this tutorial on where the art is stored. Let's take a closer look at the first ever artwork created on Code Canvas, [Fract #1 by Leander Herzog](https://codecanvas.art/single/AXVm8TLnhcXDApP5z2YsgCttspYmkY13TXKPVZPTgZuC).

When an artist creates generative art on Code Canvas, the code that generates the artwork is stored in three different places: on the Solana blockchain, on IPFS, and on Arweave.

To access the artwork, click on the link above and look for the **Metadata** hyperlink on the page. This will open up the Solana account where the artwork is stored.


## Solana

The code that generates the artwork is stored in a Solana account, identified by the address `53Veg72veKEn6zQFDbqBKZmErBQG3UFNjZHEAUDuENYW`.

:::info Accounts
Learn more about the concepts behind [Solana accounts](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts).
:::

You can use the following code to access the Solana account:

```javascript
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import fs from "fs";

(async () => {
    const rpc = "https://...";
    const connection = new Connection(rpc, "confirmed");
    const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(new PublicKey("53Veg72veKEn6zQFDbqBKZmErBQG3UFNjZHEAUDuENYW"));
    fs.writeFileSync('./code.zip', accountInfo.data);
})();

```


## IPFS

IPFS is a decentralized storage system that is used to store the code.

The code is stored at the following URI: [https://codecanvas.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWdRHWqdywuYtyfAqU7hAmjeDhaVLwFDwGo7zWcJKeWr2/fract/index.html](https://codecanvas.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWdRHWqdywuYtyfAqU7hAmjeDhaVLwFDwGo7zWcJKeWr2/fract/index.html).

## Arweave

**[Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)** is a Decentralized Storage Network that is used to store the [Artwork's metadata](https://arweave.net/tRd4ZEtqw08e9h1I-YkxVHrKpJdnt8-m88LWXlAa5Jw), the [image output](https://arweave.net/mu_Q_4e9rEK9RUjAZU9TUIrpLkvpxEKZJ7ggiqsiIdU) and the [source code](https://arweave.net/xKk_p0oplDpLrQjEkqh6AkV-JYSHG_rMXRlF57OLCiw).

# Summary
The code that generates the artworks is stored on three separate systems. This ensures that the artwork is secure and accessible to collectors worldwide.
